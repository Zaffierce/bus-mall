As a User I want a clean application that is easy to understand and use.  

As a Developer I want to display a wide range of products and capture how many times that product was viewed and voted for, then display the statistical data.

As a Marketer I want to see a summary of all my products and see how many votes are for each product.

As a Business Owner I want to see which products are being voted for the most.

As a Customer I want to vote for products that I think I may like and then find out where I could find these products.  Maybe even read some reviews about them before I purchase.
